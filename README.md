# titanic-project
The Titanic machine learning project involves using machine learning algorithms to predict whether passengers on the Titanic ship would have survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. Here we have used various classification algorithms to find the best one which gives the highest accuracy.

1. Aim: Define the specific goal of your project. In the case of the Titanic project, the aim might be to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.
2. Import Libraries: Begin by importing the necessary Python libraries and frameworks that you'll be using for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Common libraries include NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
3. Load Data: Load the Titanic dataset into your project using a library like pandas. This dataset contains information about passengers including attributes like age, gender, class, fare, etc.
4. Domain Analysis: Gain an understanding of the domain you're working in, in this case, the history and details of the Titanic disaster. This helps you make informed decisions during data preprocessing and feature engineering.
5. Basic Checks: Perform initial checks on the loaded data to ensure it's in the expected format. Check for data types, missing values, and any anomalies that might need to be addressed.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset visually and statistically to understand its distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns. EDA helps you uncover insights that could guide your preprocessing and modeling decisions.
7. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values (imputation), dealing with outliers, and addressing any inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations, which machine learning algorithms can process.
8. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of your model. For instance, you might extract titles from passenger names or engineer a family-size feature based on the number of family members aboard.
9. Model Creation: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for your classification task. Common choices include decision trees, random forests, bagging, gradient boosting, and XG boosting. Train the model using the preprocessed data.
10. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that yield the best results on your validation data.
11. Conclusion: Summarize your findings and results. Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset to get a final estimate of its predictive ability. Compare the results of different algorithms and visualize it for better understanding.
